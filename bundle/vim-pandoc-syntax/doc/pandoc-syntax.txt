*vim-pandoc-syntax*

OVERVIEW

vim-pandoc-syntax is a standalone syntax file for highlighting pandoc flavored
markdown documents, to be used alongside vim-pantondoc (see |pantondoc|). It is
based on the version provided by vim-pandoc, which it obsoletes.

The project resides at http://www.github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc-syntax. You
are welcome to help, suggesting ideas, reporting bugs or contributing code.

 - TODO

   This is a list of know stuff missing from the syntax file.

   1. Allow attributes for verbatim text, like in

          hey, `print 1 + 3`.{python} is no longer valid in python 3. 

 
CONFIGURATION				       *vim-pandoc-syntax-confguration*

+ *g:pandoc_use_conceal*
  Use |conceal| for pretty highlighting. Default is 1 for vim version > 7.3

+ *g:pandoc_syntax_dont_use_conceal_for_rules* A list of rules |conceal| should not be
  used with. Works as a blacklist, and defaults to [] (use conceal everywhere).

  This is a list of the rules wich can be used here:

  - titleblock 
  - image
  - block
  - subscript
  - superscript
  - strikeout
  - atx
  - codeblock_start
  - codeblock_delim
  - footnote
  - definition
  - list
  - newline
  - dashes
  - ellipses
  - quotes

  To review what are the rules for, look for the call to |s:WithConceal| in
  syntax/pandoc.vim that takes the corresponding  rulename as first argument.

+ *g:pandoc_syntax_user_cchars*
  A dictionary of what characters should be used in conceal rules. These
  override the defaults (see those in |s:cchars|). For example, if you prefer
  to mark footnotes with the `*` symbol:

      let g:pandoc_syntax_user_cchars = ["footnote" : "*"]

+ *g:pandoc_syntax_ignore_codeblocks*
  Prevent highlighting specific codeblock types so that they remain Normal.
  Codeblock types include 'definition' for codeblocks inside definition blocks
  and 'delimited' for delimited codeblocks. Default = []

+ *g:pandoc_use_embeds_in_codeblocks*
  Use embedded highlighting for delimited codeblocks where a language is
  specified. Default = 1

+ *g:pandoc_use_embeds_in_codeblocks_for_langs*
  For what languages and using what syntax files to highlight embeds. This is
  a list of language names. When the language pandoc and vim use don't match,
  you can use the "PANDOC=VIM" syntax. For example:

      let g:pandoc_use_embeds_in_codeblocks_for_langs = ["ruby",
      "literatehaskell=lhaskell"]

+ *g:pandoc_underline_special_blocks*
  Undeline subscript, superscript and strikeout text styles. Default = 1

COMMANDS                                            *pandoc-syntax-commands*

+ *:PandocHighlight* LANG

  Enable embedded highlighting for language LANG in codeblocks. Uses the
  syntax for items in |g:pandoc_use_embeds_in_codeblocks_for_langs|.

+ *:PandocUnhighlight* LANG

  Disable embedded highlighting for language LANG in codeblocks.

FUNCTIONS                                           *pandoc-syntax-functions*

+ *EnableEmbedsForCodeblocksWithLang(langname)*
  As |:PandocHighlight|.

+ *DisableEmbedsForCodeblocksWithLang(langname)*
  As |:PandocUnhighlight|.

+ *s:WithConceal(RULE_GROUP,RULE,CONCEAL_RULE)*
  Executes a |:syntax| command RULE, which could incorporate conceal rules
  (CONCEAL_RULE) if  conceals are enabled. The rule gets named RULE_GROUP,
  as used in |g:pandoc_syntax_dont_use_conceal_for_rules|.

  For example, if conceals are enabled

      call s:WithConceal("atx", 'syn match AtxStart /#/ contained
          containedin=pandocAtxHeader', 'conceal cchar='.s:cchars["atx"])

  will execute

      syn match AtxStart /#/ contained containedin=pandocAtxHeader conceal cchar=ยง

  and 

      syn match AtxStart /#/ contained containedin=pandocAtxHeader 

  otherwise.

MISC

The plugin sets a global variable, *g:vim_pandoc_syntax_exists* to indicate its
existence. This is currently used by vim-pantondoc to switch between syntax
assisted and basic folding rules.
