Changes in 0.77
===============

Lots of changes were made, so take care, and

   **DON'T PANIC!**

1. A brand new html theme for riv, rhythm.css_

   Provides much better view experience. 

   `Syntax Preview`__ 

   `Article Preview`__

   __ http://rykka.github.io/rhythm.css/rst_syntax
   __ http://rykka.github.io/rhythm.css/article


   Also, code syntax highlighting and themes are now truly supported,
   you can change the theme by setting ``g:riv_html_code_hl_style``, 
   default is 'molokai'. 

   (This option may change to ``g:riv_code_theme`` in future.)

   You can add your theme's css dir at ``g:riv_css_theme_dir``.
   then set the style to the filename.

   For view and edit in vim, you can use most morden themes like molokai.
   And the Galaxy.vim_ can be a good choice too.

2. Auto convert to html on ``:w``:

   Use option ``g:riv_auto_rst2html``, set it to 1 to active.
   default is 0. 

   If you even don't want to refresh the browser, use InstantRst_.

3. New syntax and method for local files, 
   which is much simpler, and robust.

   see `#72`_ for details.

   Just input ``xxx.rst`` or ``xxx/``,
   Then use ``:RivCreatLink`` or ``<C-E>ck``, 
   you will get the file link.

   When click on a reference which location is a file link,
   you will open it directly.

   To disable this, set ``g:riv_open_link_location`` to 0.
   Then you will move to that location only.
   default is 1.

   :NOTE: When convert to html,
          the xxx.rst in the file location will be auto convert
          to xxx.html for navigation in browser.
   
   :NOTE:

       The moinmoin style (``[[xxxx]]``) is deprecated, and will be removed
       in next few versions.

       The sphinx style (``:doc:`xxxx```) will go on.

4. Unicode Link names.

   Reference links now supporting unicode names.

   Also filename supports unicode names too, 
   though that's not encouraged.

   like::

       名字_

       .. 名字: name.rst

5. Better and faster indent behavior.

   see `#71`_ for details.

6. Fixed lots of misc bugs and made lots of small optimization

   The error phase ptn. 

   Project's id working error.

   Editing a file missing working directory.

   Syntax highlighting error and optimize.

   Improved doctest using doctest.vim_

   ...

Here is the Screencast: 

* Riv: QuickStart_ (HD)


New To Vim
----------

* If you are new to Vim, you can get a basic overview of Vim using
  ``vimtutor``. To use it simply type ``vimtutor`` in your shell.
  
* To view the quick reference of Vim, use ``:h quickref``.

New TO Rst
----------

* To get a quick overview of reStructuredText, some of the available options
  are:

  Read "`A ReStructuredText Primer`_". You can use ``:RivPrimer`` to open it in
  Vim. Or, you can read "`Quick reStructuredText`_".

* For a detailed look at reStructuredText's specifications, take a look at
  "`reStructuredText Specification`_". You can use ``:RivSpecification`` to
  open it in Vim.

* Finally, you can use "`reStructuredText cheatsheet`_" for a quick review. Use
  ``:RivCheatSheet`` to open it in Vim.

New To Riv
----------

* For getting started with Riv, read "`QuickStart With Riv`_".
  You can also view it using ``:RivQuickStart`` in Vim.

* Detailed instructions for Riv are available at "`Instructions`_". Use
  ``:RivInstruction`` to read the same in Vim.

Issues
======

The bug tracker for Riv is at https://github.com/Rykka/riv.vim/issues.
You can use it to report bugs and open feature requests. Discussions related
to Riv are welcome too. 

You can follow my twitter `@rykkaf`_ and notice me there too.

Common Issues
-------------

* If you get errors with folding in documents, you can try to force reload
  using ``:RivReload`` or ``<C-E>t```.

  Or just `:w` as it will auto refolding after saving.

* Windows:
  
  - Converting to other formats may fail. 
    
    This could happen due to Docutils not working correctly with
    ``vimrun.exe``.

* Mac OS:

  - Lists don't act as expected.
  
    This could happen if the ``<C-Enter>`` key could not be mapped. Try some
    other mapping instead.
